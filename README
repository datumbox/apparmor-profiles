------------
Introduction
------------
This repository contains AppArmor profiles that are currently in
development. Once a profile reaches maturity, it gets removed from this
repository and moved into a distribution's official packaging.


----------------
Directory Layout
----------------
Each distribution gets it's own top-level directory, which contains a
subdirectory for each release. Typically, when a new release opens for
development, a new directory will be created and profiles from the previous
release will be copied over.


--------------
Using profiles
--------------
AppArmor profiles can be copied out of this repository into the
/etc/apparmor.d directory. Some profiles may include extra files and
abstractions that need to be copied over also. Once the files are in
place, the profile will need to be reloaded.

For example, on Ubuntu:
sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/profile.name

For more information, please see the appropriate documentation for your
specific distribution here:
