# Description: Limit executable access and reasonable read access. A look at
# the gconf schema files for totem-video-thumbnailer reveals at least the
# following files:
#  3gpp, ac3, acm, aiff, amr-wb, ape, asf, asx, au, avi, basic, divx, dv, flac,
#  flc, fli, flic, flv, google-video-pointer, gpp, gsm, m4a, m4v, matroska,
#  midi, mod, mp3, mp4, mp4es, mpeg, mpt2, msvideo, ms-wm, musepack,mxf,
#  netshow, nsv, off, ogm, pict, pn-realaudio, prs.sid, quicktime, ram,
#  realpix, rn, sbc, sdp, shorten, speex, theora, totem-stream, tta, ultravox,
#  vivo, vorbis, wav, wavpack, wax, webm, wma, wmv, wmx, wpl, wvx, x-anim,
#  x-it, xm
#
# While ideally we would narrow down our read access to the above, this is
# a maintenance problem and doesn't work for files without extensions.
